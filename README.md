# 🌱 AllIsWell – NGO Website

AllIsWell is a simple and clean website built for an NGO to present its work, values, and activities in a clear and friendly way. The main goal of this project is to create a strong online presence for the organization using a modern, responsive design that works well on all devices.

This repository contains the full front-end source code for the website along with a small Node.js-based setup for running the project locally. At the moment, the focus is on design, structure, and user experience. A donation/payment system is planned for the future but is **not implemented yet**.

## 🧩 About the Project

AllIsWell was created to help an NGO share its story and connect better with people online. The website highlights the organization’s mission, ongoing activities, and impact through a clean layout and easy navigation.

The project is built on top of the **Dewi BootstrapMade template** and customized to match the needs of the NGO, including custom sections, styling, and content structure.

In addition, the project includes a **GPS coordinate finder** placed in the footer of the website. This tool captures the geographic coordinates of the user’s current location. These coordinates are then used during the **certificate generation process** to embed the location details into the certificate.

## 📍 GPS Coordinate Finder

The footer of the website includes a GPS-based coordinate finder. When a user allows location access, the system fetches the current latitude and longitude of their location. These coordinates are stored and later used while generating certificates, helping link each certificate to the actual place where it was created.

**Current Status:**

* Location access: Implemented on the front end
* Coordinate capture: Enabled
* Certificate integration: Supported in the generation flow

---

## 🔐 Certificate Access & Login

The project includes a dedicated login page for certificate access. Each user is given **specific credentials** by the organization. Using these credentials, the user can log in and view or download **only their own certificate**.

**How it works:**

* The NGO provides a unique username and password to each person
* The user logs in through the certificate access page
* After successful login, the system shows the certificate linked to that user
* The user can view or download their certificate

---

## 🧪 Planned Donation Feature

The website is designed with a future donation feature in mind. The idea is to allow visitors to contribute online using a payment gateway (such as Razorpay or a similar service).

**Current Status:**

* Payment system: Not implemented
* Backend: Not available
* Front-end: Layout and structure ready for future integration

---

## 🎯 Future Improvements

* 💳 Add a secure online donation system
* 📊 Simple admin panel for managing content
* 📧 Email notifications or contact forms
* 📱 Convert to a Progressive Web App (PWA)
